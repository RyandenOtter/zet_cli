# Zet App

This little application is a tool that I wrote to help me quickly create Zettelkasten notes.

# Installation
NOTE: It is currently not compiled as a package or anything. So, for the time being you have to run it manually.
- Clone the git repo.
- Connect the pipenv by running `pipenv shell`
- Navigate the `zet_cli` folder.
- Execute the `run` command:
```bash
python __main__.py new
```
